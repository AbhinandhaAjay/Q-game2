Q game is a tile-based game for 2 to 4 players. These players place the tiles on an infinitely large “table.” The square shape of the tiles and the rules of the game induce the notions of row and column on the evolving map formation.

Players place tiles according to rather basic rules. Every placement yields a certain number of points. When a player can use all of its tiles during a single turn, the game ends. The game also ends when all game tiles have been placed or all players pass during a round.

The player with the highest total score wins.
